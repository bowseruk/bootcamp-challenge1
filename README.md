# Bootcamp Challenge 1

## Description 

For this project, the website must meet accessibility standards. This was achieved by completing the following:

* Div elements changed to Semantic HTML elements throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

This improved the usability of the inital code with screen readers.

## Installation

The site does not require installation steps.

## Usage 

The website can be viewed at [https://](http://) with Google Chrome. The source can be viewed in Chrome by right clicking and selecting inspect.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```
