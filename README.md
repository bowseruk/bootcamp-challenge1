# Bootcamp Challenge 1

## Description 

For this project, a webpage was editted to meet accessibility standards. This was achieved by completing the following:

* Div elements changed to Semantic HTML elements throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

This improved the accesibility of the inital code with technologies such as screen readers.
